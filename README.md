Sleep, Steps & Salads: How Small Changes Save Your Heart & Mind

A Data-Driven Exploration of Lifestyle’s Impact on Health
Modern life often pushes us toward convenience—sitting for hours, grabbing processed snacks, and sacrificing sleep. But what does data say about these habits? Using R Studio, I analyzed a Sleep, Health, and Lifestyle dataset to uncover how small, intentional changes—like better sleep, more movement, and cleaner eating—can tremendously improve physical and mental well-being.

Note on Methodology
Dataset: This analysis uses sample data to practice data manipulation (e.g., cleaning BP metrics) and visualization in R Studio (ggplot2, dplyr).
Collaboration: Special thanks to Riya Agarwal (MBBS final year) for clinical insights on health thresholds.

Key Insights from the Data
1. Sleep: The Ultimate Stress Reliever
Finding: Sleep duration and stress levels are inversely proportional.
Adults (Men: 25–43 yrs, Women: 30–52 yrs) averaging <7 hours of sleep had higher stress.
Those prioritizing 7–8 hours showed lower stress, especially post-middle age.
Why It Matters: Poor sleep affects stress hormones, making it harder to recover and concentrate.

2. Move More, Fear Less (Your Heart Will Thank You) 
Finding: More daily steps are linked to a healthier heart rate. 
Males show lower heart rates with more walking, especially before age 48. After 48, reduced activity often leads to higher heart rates.
Females with low step counts in youth have slightly higher heart rates. Increased walking after 48 improves heart rate in females.
Conclusion: Walking more helps maintain a healthy heart at any age.

3. Junk Food vs. Blood Pressure: A Losing Battle
Finding: Higher BMI often leads to higher blood pressure, especially in obese individuals.
Age and gender influence this link—males are more prone to obesity and high BP as they get older.
Females tend to show higher BP when overweight, especially after age 40.
BP becomes harder to manage with age, but a healthy lifestyle can help control it.

4. Occupation’s Hidden Tax on Health
Salespeople (Men) & Teachers (Women): Highest insomnia rates due to high-pressure workloads.
Nurses: Frequent sleep apnea from night shifts.
"Saving lives, chasing quotas, and grading papers don’t mix well with quality sleep." Yet these professionals keep our society running.

The Power of Small, Consistent Changes
Personal Recommendations for a Healthier Lifestyle
Research and data suggest that small, consistent habits can lead to significant and lasting improvements in overall health and well-being. Here are three key practices to consider:
1) Prioritize Sleep – 7–8 hours of quality sleep reduces stress and boosts productivity.
2) Stay Active – Regular exercise and a balanced diet support heart health and blood pressure.
3) Manage Stress – Reducing work-related stress helps prevent sleep disorders and improves well-being.
